One issue with DNS configuration is that it should be done with precison because Computers that belong to a given domains look up records in DNS to locate a Domain Controller. Without DNS, users can't find those Domain Controllers and can't access any of the domain's resources â€“ including authentication services, which are required to log in.
DNS database is very important but more crucial when its infrastructure spans multiple continents, operating systems and DNS implementations. Managing such a distributed system will require more administrators with similar expertise in more locations, and with experience in the various OSs and name servers involved.
