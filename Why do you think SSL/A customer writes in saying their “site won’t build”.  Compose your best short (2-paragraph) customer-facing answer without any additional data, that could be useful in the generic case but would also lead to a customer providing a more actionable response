Here’s what you do:

Get a domain name and set up on one page what your product does.
On the page say “If you’re interested, please enter your email address.”
Display your email address and have any questions directed to that address.
Promote the heck out of the page. Keep it up until you feel you have a statistically significant amount of visitors.
If you don’t get the response you were looking for, don’t build it. If the response is good, build it.
